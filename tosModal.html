 <div class="modal-body"> <br /><br /><h1>1. Acceptance of the Terms of Service</h1> <p>Welcome to <strong>qList</strong>! (a.k.a. "<strong>we</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>" or the "<strong>Company</strong>"). The following terms and conditions (collectively, these "<strong>Terms of Service</strong>") apply to your use of qList.cc, including any content, functionality and services offered on or via qList.cc (the "<strong>Website</strong>").</p> <p> We want to keep our relationship with you as lean and informal as possible, but please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start using qList, because <strong>by using the Website you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service</strong>. </p> <p> Should you disagree with some of the provisions herein, you can either leave the Website (although we'll be sad to see you go!), or contact us using the feedback link at the bottom of the webpage, and we'll be happy to hear your comments and suggestions. </p> <h1>2. Changes to the Terms of Service and the Website </h1> <p> qList is a work in progress, meaning that a lot will change in the near future. We reserve the right to update the Website and these Terms of Service from time to time, at our discretion. <strong>Your continued use of the Website following the publishing of updated Terms of Service means that you accept and agree to the changes.</strong> </p> <h1>3. Accessing the Website, Security and Privacy </h1> <p> We do not guarantee that the Website will be up and running 24/7. We also reserve the right to suspend or restrict access to some features to users. In any case, we will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Website is unavailable at any time or for any period, nor for any data loss (see also section 7 below). </p> <p> We do not guarantee that use will be secure or private. Anyone can access and alter to the list data you provide by guessing your list URL. </p> <p> We also do not guarantee that the Website or any content provided on the Website is error free. </p> <p> We collect anonymous data from every visitor of the Website to monitor traffic and fix bugs. For example, we collect information like web requests, the data sent in response to such requests, the Internet Protocol address, the browser type, the browser language, and a timestamp for the request. </p> <p> <strong>We do not share personal information you have provided to us without your consent</strong> , unless: </p> <ul> <li> doing so is appropriate to carry out your own request; </li> <li> we believe it's needed to enforce our Terms of Service, or that is legally required; </li> <li> we believe it's needed to detect, prevent or address fraud, security or technical issues; </li> <li> otherwise protect our property, legal rights, or that of others. </li> </ul> <p> Minors and children should not use qList. By using the Website, you represent that you have the legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement. </p> <p> We don't share your personal information with third parties. Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to help us improve the Website and service. We currently use Google Analytics (traffic analysis, SEO optimization). We list below what data this third party extracts </p> <ul> <li> Google Analytics: anonymous (ad serving domains, browser type, demographics, language settings, page views, time/date), pseudonymous (IP address) </li> </ul> <div> <p> We may employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our “Agents”).

Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents. </p> <p> We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy. </p> </div> <h1>4.
